## Introduction  
This project leverages Python's data science stack to analyze the critical relationship between global CO₂ emissions and temperature anomalies. By applying statistical modeling and climate science methodologies, I quantify emission impacts, forecast warming scenarios, and deliver actionable insights for climate mitigation strategies, turning atmospheric data into actionable climate intelligence.

## Background
Atmospheric CO₂ concentrations have surged 50% since pre-industrial levels, creating unprecedented demand for emission intelligence systems. This project builds the analytical infrastructure that converts NOAA and IPCC datasets sourced from Statso into precision decarbonization insights-the same tools powering carbon markets, ESG reporting, and the $7.5B climate analytics industry.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Statso and represents data compiled by NOAA and the IPCC. It includes two main components: one with annual temperature anomalies across multiple countries and decades, and another with monthly global CO₂ concentration levels. The temperature dataset records changes relative to a historical baseline, while the CO₂ dataset captures atmospheric carbon levels in parts per million. By combining these datasets, we can explore historical trends, identify anomalies, and model future climate scenarios, offering data-driven insights into the relationship between carbon emissions and global temperature changes.

## Problem Statement
Climate change, fueled by increasing CO₂ concentrations, has become a pressing global concern, highlighting the urgent need for data-driven insights to inform effective policy-making.
This analysis seeks to understand the impact of carbon emissions on global temperatures by examining the relationship between key climate variables-including CO₂ concentrations, temperature anomalies, and their temporal dynamics-and how they collectively inform climate response strategies.

### Core Objectives:
#### Historical Trend Analysis
- Identify long-term correlations between CO₂ levels and temperature anomalies
- Understand the influence of industrialization and human activities on global warming

#### Anomaly Detection
- Detect significant deviations from climate trends
- Attribute anomalies to natural or anthropogenic events (e.g., volcanic eruptions, emission surges)

#### Scenario Simulation
- Model “what-if” scenarios to forecast temperature responses to varying CO₂ levels
- Quantify the potential impact of emission increases or reductions

### Policy Impact:
The findings will equip policymakers to:
- Design evidence-based emission reduction strategies
- Set realistic climate targets grounded in historical and predictive data
- Prioritize climate actions based on high-impact intervention points
